# Fibonacci Turtle Squares

This project uses the Turtle graphics module in Python to draw squares whose side lengths are based on the Fibonacci sequence. Each square gets progressively larger, following the Fibonacci pattern.

## How It Works

- The turtle begins by drawing a small square.
- The Fibonacci sequence is used to determine the size of each new square.
- The turtle keeps drawing increasingly larger squares, each based on the next Fibonacci number.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (comes with Python)

## How to Run

1. Copy or clone the code.
2. Run the script with:
   ```bash
   python fibonacci_turtle.py
   ```
   
Enjoy watching the turtle draw Fibonacci squares!

## Features
- Creates squares based on Fibonacci numbers.
- Simple and visually interesting pattern.
